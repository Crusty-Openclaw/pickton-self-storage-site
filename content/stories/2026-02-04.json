  "body": "The morning after the owl, Pickton Farms felt like it was holding its breath—quiet, frosty, and careful. The coffee-can wind chime kept time in the pecan tree, clinking soft and uneven, like it was reminding the day to move gentle.\n\nScott sat with his mug and watched Bo do his loop: porch steps, woodpile, gate. Same route, same seriousness. Only this time Bo paused at the barn door, looking back like the barn had unfinished business.\n\nStephanie stepped out with a small metal pan in her hands and a rag tucked into her back pocket. “Before you go in there and start a new project,” she said, “we’re gonna do the one we already found.”\n\nScott eyed the pan. “That’s not breakfast.”\n\n“It’s a clean-up,” Stephanie said. “Lantern’s been sittin’ in dust long enough.”\n\nScott let out a sound halfway between a grunt and a surrender. “Alright.”\n\nThey set the old lantern on the porch rail where the light could find it. Up close, it looked like every hard year it had lived through: thin soot on the glass, a handle worn smooth by hands that didn’t waste motion, and a little cap that was bent just slightly off-center.\n\nStephanie poured a bit of warm water into the pan and dipped the rag. “Your daddy’s lantern?”\n\nScott nodded. “Hung on a nail in the barn. Storms, late calves, power goin’ out… that lantern kept the dark from gettin’ too bold.”\n\nBo sat down beside the lantern like he was on honor guard duty.\n\nScott took the rag and started on the glass, slow circles, watching clean show up like a promise. “Funny,” he said, “how you can forget somethin’ till you’re holdin’ it again.”\n\nStephanie cleaned the metal frame. “People don’t forget,” she replied. “They just set it down somewhere safe and think they’ll come back to it. That’s why closets get full and hearts get tired.”\n\nScott snorted softly. “That sounds like you been thinkin’.”\n\n“I been watchin’,” Stephanie said. “You told Toby you’d give him better twine. You told Mrs. Riddle we’d check on her after she gets settled. You told yourself you’d get that lantern ready ‘one of these days.’”\n\nScott rubbed at a stubborn smudge. “Well, I’m workin’ on it.”\n\nBo rose and trotted to the edge of the porch, ears perked. A sound had come up the drive—an ATV, familiar and eager.\n\nToby rolled in slow, careful over the gravel like he’d learned that speed and respect can’t ride in the same seat. He shut the engine off at the gate and waved. “Mornin’, Mr. Scott! Ms. Stephanie!”\n\n“Mornin’,” Scott called back. “You here about that twine?”\n\nToby’s grin widened. “Yes sir. Grandpa said I’m in charge of keepin’ the fence line tidy. Which mostly means I’m in charge of fixin’ what I accidentally untied.”\n\nStephanie laughed. “Come on up.”\n\nToby walked up and stopped when he saw the lantern. “That is cool,” he said, like he’d stumbled into a museum.\n\nScott held the lantern up a little. “Old tool. Still matters.”\n\nToby nodded like he understood more than his age ought to. Then he looked around, voice dropping. “How’s the owl?”\n\nStephanie’s face softened. “Elena took it in. She said she’d keep us posted.”\n\nToby kicked at a pebble. “I been thinkin’ about it. Like… it was just sittin’ there. And y’all didn’t freak out. You just… did what you could.”\n\nScott set the lantern down. “We did what we could and we called somebody who could do more. That’s the part I’m still learnin’.”\n\nToby reached into his jacket and pulled out a tight roll of bright orange twine. “Grandpa bought a whole spool,” he said. “He said to give y’all some too, since y’all are always helpin’ folks.”\n\nScott raised an eyebrow. “I thought I was helpin’ you.”\n\nToby shrugged, embarrassed. “Yeah, but… Grandpa says help don’t keep score. It just keeps goin’.”\n\nStephanie accepted the twine and set it on the porch rail. “Tell your grandpa thank you.”\n\nBo sniffed Toby’s hand, then leaned his shoulder into Toby’s knee—just a little. Toby froze, pleased.\n\n“He likes you,” Stephanie said.\n\nScott corrected, “He approves of you. Different thing.”\n\nWhile Toby and Bo sorted out their friendship terms, Scott opened the lantern’s little cap and checked the wick. It was dry and brittle, frayed at the end like it had quit hoping. He pulled it up a touch and frowned. “This wick’s done.”\n\nStephanie watched him. “Do we have another?”\n\nScott hesitated. He could almost see his own habit, standing there in front of him: keepin’ things even when they didn’t work anymore, because tossing them felt like admitting time was real.\n\n“Not here,” he said.\n\nToby perked up. “My grandpa’s got a lantern in his shed! He uses it when he goes catfishin’ at night. I bet he’s got extra wicks too.”\n\nScott started to say, We’ll handle it, but the words didn’t make it out. The whole last day had been about callin’ and acceptin’. About letting community do what community was made to do.\n\nHe nodded. “Could you ask him?”\n\nToby looked proud to be trusted with a real mission. “Yes sir. I’ll go right now.”\n\nHe climbed back on the ATV and rolled out, Bo watching him go with a tail that wagged once, slow and serious.\n\nA little later, Stephanie’s phone rang. She checked the screen and answered with a warm, careful hello. Scott could tell by the way her shoulders settled that it was good news.\n\nWhen she hung up, she smiled. “Elena.”\n\nScott set his mug down. “And?”\n\n“She said the wing’s sprained, not broken,” Stephanie said. “They’ve got it in a quiet room, keepin’ it warm, and it’s already eatin’ a little. She said it’ll probably be able to go back out in a couple weeks if it keeps heal-in’ like this.”\n\nScott let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holdin’. “Thank the Lord.”\n\nStephanie nodded. “She also said somethin’ else.”\n\nScott waited.\n\n“She said it’s funny how often injured animals get found near folks’ ‘later piles,’” Stephanie told him, eyes gentle but sharp. “She said it like a joke, but it felt like a nudge.”\n\nScott looked toward the barn, then back to the lantern. “Yeah,” he admitted. “The world has a way of findin’ our corners.”\n\nThey sat quiet for a bit, listening to the coffee-can chime and the distant road. Out past the pasture, a pair of crows argued in the cedar line, and somewhere a squirrel scolded the whole operation.\n\nThen a small pickup turned into the drive—Mr. Harlan’s, slow and steady. Toby sat in the passenger seat with a grin, holding a paper sack like it was treasure.\n\nMr. Harlan climbed out, tipped his cap, and came up the porch steps without hurry. “Mornin’,” he said. “Heard y’all are bringin’ an antique back to life.”\n\nScott stood. “Just cleanin’ it. Needs a wick.”\n\nMr. Harlan nodded toward the sack. “Toby insisted we bring supplies. Said you asked.”\n\nScott looked at Toby. “I did.”\n\nToby held the sack out with both hands. Inside were two new wicks, still in their little wrappers, and a small bottle of lamp oil.\n\nMr. Harlan added, “And I brought somethin’ else.”\n\nHe reached into the truck and pulled out a dusty padlock—solid, heavy, the kind that didn’t pretend to be fancy. He set it on the porch rail beside the lantern.\n\nScott frowned. “What’s that for?”\n\nMr. Harlan rubbed his jaw. “Mrs. Riddle called me last night, flustered. Said she got to her sister’s place and realized she’d packed her storage unit key in a box labeled ‘Kitchen—Don’t Open Till Later.’”\n\nStephanie’s eyes widened. “Oh no.”\n\nMr. Harlan nodded. “She didn’t wanna bother anybody. Said she’d figure it out. But I told her that’s what neighbors are for. I’m headin’ into town later to pick up a few things and swing by the storage office. I figured I’d bring a fresh lock, just in case y’all want to cut the old one and set her up clean.”\n\nScott picked the padlock up, turning it in his hand. The weight of it felt like responsibility, but not the lonely kind. The shared kind.\n\n“Thank you,” Scott said.\n\nMr. Harlan shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal, but his eyes said he understood. “We all got seasons where our hands are full. Sometimes your hands are full of boxes. Sometimes they’re full of worry.”\n\nStephanie reached over and squeezed his arm. “We’ll take care of her.”\n\nMr. Harlan glanced at the lantern. “You gonna light it?”\n\nScott slid the new wick into place, trimmed it neat, and poured just a touch of oil like he’d done it a thousand times and also like he was relearnin’ it. He looked at Stephanie.\n\nShe nodded once. “Go on.”\n\nScott struck a match. The flame flared bright, then settled. He touched it to the wick. For a moment nothing happened, and his heart did that silly little thing where it wants to doubt.\n\nThen the lantern caught.\n\nA soft, steady light filled the glass, warm as a kitchen window at dusk. Bo lifted his head, eyes reflecting gold. Toby smiled wide. Even Mr. Harlan looked pleased, like he’d watched an old friend wake up.\n\nScott held the lantern up, turning it slow, watchin’ it throw light on their faces and the porch boards and the rail. It wasn’t bright enough to flood the whole farm, but it didn’t need to be. It was enough for the next step.\n\nStephanie’s voice was quiet. “That’s what a promise ought to be,” she said. “Not a speech. Just a light somebody can count on.”\n\nScott swallowed. He set the lantern down gently beside the padlock and the new twine—three small things, all simple, all useful.\n\nLater, after Mr. Harlan and Toby headed back down the drive, Scott and Stephanie sat with Bo at their feet. The coffee-can chime kept its soft clatter, and the lantern’s warm glow looked almost comical in the daylight—like you were wearing your boots inside.\n\nBut Scott didn’t blow it out right away.\n\nHe let it burn a little, just to remind himself.\n\nBecause the lesson of the day wasn’t flashy, and it didn’t need to be: keep your word. Do the next right thing. And when life gets heavy and you’re tempted to say, ‘I’ll handle it alone,’ remember that faith and family and community were never meant to be one-man work. They’re a lantern passed from hand to hand—steady enough to guide you, and warm enough to bring you back home."
