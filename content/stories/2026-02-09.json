  "body": "Monday showed up with a thin sun and a stiff breeze, the kind that made the pecan limbs creak like they were clearin’ their throats. Out on Pickton Farms, the 16 acres looked half-asleep—pasture pale, cedar line dark, and the barn standing steady like it had been prayin’ through the night.
\n\nScott stood at the porch rail with his coffee warming his hands. The coffee-can wind chime clinked and stumbled through a little tune. Bo sat near the steps, ears angled toward the driveway, alert but unbothered.
\n\nStephanie came out carrying the button jar and set it beside Scott’s daddy’s lantern, right where the morning light could hit the glass. “Marcus said he’d be here after his shift starts,” she said. “He’s coming on his break.”
\n\nScott grunted in that way he used when he was feelin’ grateful but didn’t want to give pride too much room to talk. “Break ain’t much time.”
\n\n“Neither is life,” Stephanie replied, and sipped her own coffee like that was the whole sermon.
\n\nBo’s tail thumped once. A truck turned up the drive, gravel crunching slow. Marcus eased in like he’d learned the farm’s rhythm already—no hurry, no drama, just showing up.
\n\nHe climbed out with a work apron still tied around his waist and a small cooler in his hand. “Mornin’,” he called. “Hope I’m not early.”
\n\n“You’re on time for good work,” Stephanie said.
\n\nMarcus smiled, then noticed the button jar. His hand drifted toward his pocket without him thinkin’ about it. “I kept that red button,” he admitted. “Didn’t know what to do with it, so I just… carried it. Felt silly. But also felt like…” He searched for the word.
\n\n“Like you weren’t alone,” Scott said, surprising himself with how easy it came out.
\n\nMarcus nodded. “Yes sir.”
\n\nScott set his mug down and jerked his chin toward the barn. “Alright then. Let’s go see what kind of trouble my ‘later corner’ has been breedin’.”
\n\nThey walked down together—Scott, Stephanie, Marcus, and Bo. The barn smelled like hay dust and old tools, like a place that had held a lot of stories without ever speaking up about it.
\n\nScott pointed to the cleared space where the owl had rested. The straw was still there, a shallow nest. “Looks odd empty,” he said.
\n\nStephanie’s voice softened. “Elena texted again. She’s thinkin’ they can release it Wednesday if the wing keeps improving.”
\n\nMarcus looked down at the nest. “I’ve never seen an owl up close,” he said.
\n\n“It looked at you like it could see right through whatever you were hidin’,” Scott told him. “That’s what got me.”
\n\nBo sniffed the nest, then sneezed and backed away like he’d decided that mercy smells fine but straw in the nose is unacceptable.
\n\nThey started on the barn’s back wall where Scott had stacked things for years—old buckets with cracked handles, a bent rake, two empty feed bins, and a wheelbarrow with a flat tire, sunk down in the dirt like it had given up on being useful.
\n\nMarcus crouched by the wheelbarrow and pressed a thumb into the rubber. “This ain’t just low,” he said. “It’s dead.”
\n\nScott shrugged. “I was gonna fix it. One day.”
\n\nStephanie didn’t look at Scott. She looked at the wheelbarrow like it was a child that had been neglected. “One day has been sittin’ here a while.”
\n\nMarcus stood and wiped his hands on his apron. “We can patch it,” he said, “but you’ll need a tube. Or we can swap the whole wheel. Do you use it much?”
\n\nScott opened his mouth to say no, but the truth wouldn’t let him. “I use it when I remember I need it,” he said.
\n\nMarcus’s grin came quick. “That’s most folks.”
\n\nThey sorted and stacked, making three piles: keep, give, and trash. Stephanie kept the pace steady, not frantic—just faithful. Scott found himself telling small stories about each item, like he was tryin’ to justify why it had stayed.
\n\n“This rake belonged to my cousin,” Scott said, holding the bent handle.
\n\n“Then let’s fix the handle or let it go,” Stephanie replied. “Keepsake don’t have to mean clutter.”
\n\nMarcus worked quiet, but he listened. Every so often he’d ask a question that was less about objects and more about people. “Mrs. Riddle really moved?” he asked.
\n\n“She did,” Stephanie said. “Left a quilt square, and that button jar.”
\n\nMarcus nodded like he understood what it meant to leave something with your hands when your feet had to go somewhere else.
\n\nBo kept making patrols in a slow circle, nose down. Once he stopped dead and stared at the far barn door. Scott followed his gaze and saw two wild turkeys outside, bobbing their heads like they’d heard there was activity and wanted to supervise.
\n\n“Don’t you start,” Scott warned them through the crack in the door.
\n\nThe turkeys didn’t care. They strutted past like they owned the place.
\n\nMarcus laughed, and it wasn’t a polite laugh. It was the kind that comes out when a heart’s been tight for too long and finally gets a little room.
\n\nNear the bottom of a feed bin, Marcus found a small spiral notebook, dusty and curled at the edges. He opened it careful. Inside were pages of Scott’s handwriting—crooked, practical.
\n\nStephanie leaned in. “What’s that?”
\n\nScott blinked at it. “My list,” he said, and then corrected himself. “My… old list.”
\n\nIt wasn’t just chores. It was reminders: CALL Harlan. FIX gate hinge. CHECK barn corner. PRAY for Elena’s dad. BUY dog food. It hit Scott in the chest how many times he’d written the word PRAY like it was another errand, something he could check off when the work got done.
\n\nMarcus read a line and stopped. “This says ‘leave room for folks,’” he said.
\n\nScott’s face went warm. “That was my daddy,” he admitted. “He used to say it. Said a place can get so full of stuff there ain’t any space left for people.”
\n\nStephanie touched Scott’s arm. “You wrote it down because you knew it was true.”
\n\nMarcus closed the notebook and set it on a shelf where it could be seen. “If you don’t mind me sayin’,” he said, “that’s what this corner felt like. Not just full of junk. Full of… avoiding.”
\n\nScott let the words settle. He could’ve bristled. Instead he nodded. “That’s fair.”
\n\nThey worked until Marcus checked his watch and hissed through his teeth. “I gotta get back,” he said. “But—” He glanced at the wheelbarrow again, then at Scott. “If you’ll let me, I can swing by after supper with a new wheel. I can pick it up in town. No charge. Just… let me help.”
\n\nScott looked at Stephanie. Her expression said what her words didn’t: receive the gift.
\n\nScott cleared his throat. “Alright,” he said. “But we’re feedin’ you.”
\n\nMarcus smiled like he’d been offered more than a plate. “Deal.”
\n\nWhen Marcus drove out, the barn looked different. Not perfect—just honest. The piles were smaller. The corners were open. The air even felt like it could move.
\n\nStephanie picked up the notebook and flipped to a blank page. She tore it clean and wrote a short list in neat letters:
\n\nWEDNESDAY — Owl release (go, if we can)
\n\nTODAY — Thank God for help that shows up
\n\nScott watched her. “You think God cares about a wheelbarrow?” he asked, half joking.
\n\nStephanie didn’t smile. She looked him right in the eye. “I think God cares about whatever keeps you from making room for folks,” she said. “And I think He cares about whatever makes it easier for you to say yes when help arrives.”
\n\nBo trotted over and leaned his shoulder into Scott’s leg—steady, warm weight. Scott scratched behind Bo’s ears and listened to the wind chime up on the porch, clinking like a patient reminder.
\n\nThe lesson landed plain: sometimes the holiest thing you can do is stop calling it ‘later.’ Fix the wheel. Clear the corner. Put the notebook where you can see it. Make space—real space—for the people God sends down your driveway. And when a neighbor offers to carry something heavy, don’t rob him of the blessing by insisting you can do it alone."
