  "body": "The sun came up slow over Pickton Farms, like it had to think about it first.\n\nScott was already on the porch with a coffee cup that had seen better decades. Stephanie sat beside him, wrapped in a quilt, watching the frost burn off the grass in thin silver streaks.\n\nBo—the black dog—trotted out into the yard and stopped at the fence line. He stared at a fence post like it owed him money.\n\nScott squinted. \"That post wasn’t leaning yesterday.\"\n\nStephanie didn’t look away from the field. \"Nothing stays the same out here. Not even fence posts.\"\n\nRight then a commotion rattled the brush: a wild hog, bold as Sunday shoes, burst through the cedar and dashed across the back acre. Bo took off after it—fast, low, and serious—but he didn’t chase with anger. He chased like it was his job, like order in the world depended on it.\n\nThe hog skidded, snorted, and cut right behind the leaning fence post. The post wobbled once… then settled, straighter than before.\n\nBo stopped, sat, and looked back toward the porch like he’d done something polite.\n\nScott nodded, satisfied. \"See? He fixed it.\"\n\nStephanie smiled into her coffee. \"Or maybe the post just needed a reason.\"\n\nDown the road, a neighbor’s truck rumbled to life, and somewhere in the trees a hawk made its morning announcement. Scott and Stephanie sat quiet, letting the day line itself up—one small thing at a time."
