  "title": "Porch Sittin: The Coffee Can Wind Chime",
  "body": "It was one of those Pickton Farms mornings when the cold felt honest—just enough bite to make the coffee taste like it meant something. Frost sat on the pasture like powdered sugar, and the cedar breaks held onto their shadows a little longer than usual.\n\nScott rocked slow in his chair, the old wood giving that familiar porch-song squeak at the bottom of every swing. He held his mug with both hands like he was warming up a memory. Stephanie was beside him in her quilt, hair tucked under a cap, looking out over the 16 acres like she was reading a book she’d already memorized but still enjoyed.\n\nBo—the black dog—was on patrol, nose low, tail level, acting like the whole place had been put in his care by official paperwork. Every so often he’d stop, look up at Scott, and then continue on, like he was giving a report nobody had asked for.\n\nScott nodded toward the corner post by the gate. \"You hear that?\"\n\nStephanie listened. At first it was nothing but the quiet: a far-off rooster from somebody’s place down the road, the whisper of wind skimming the dormant grass. Then she caught it—a soft, uneven clink. Like somebody tapping a spoon on a glass, slow and thoughtful.\n\n\"That ain’t our wind chime,\" she said. \"Ours is the little one with the blue beads.\"\n\nScott squinted, eyes narrowing like he could bring the sound into focus. \"Sounds like… tin.\"\n\nBo heard it too. His ears perked, and he turned his head the way dogs do when they’re deciding whether something is trouble or just interesting. Then he padded off the porch steps and headed toward the side yard.\n\nStephanie stood up with a little groan that she tried to hide. \"Well, if Bo’s investigating, we might as well pretend we’re supervising.\"\n\nScott grinned and pushed himself up. \"I’m supervising from a distance. You’re the field agent.\"\n\nThey followed Bo along the edge of the porch, past the stacked firewood and the old wash tub Scott kept insisting he’d use ‘one day’ for something. The clinking got clearer as they moved, and by the time they reached the pecan tree, it was plain as day: something metal was swinging from a low branch.\n\nBo stopped under it and sat, looking up like it was a lesson he was waiting to be taught.\n\nHanging there, tied with a frayed bit of baling twine, was an old Folgers coffee can—dented, rust-speckled, and cut into strips so it would move with the breeze. Somebody had made a wind chime out of it. When the wind breathed through, it tapped itself together in a soft, lopsided rhythm that sounded like a porch in the making.\n\nStephanie reached up and steadied it. \"Where in the world did this come from?\"\n\nScott leaned in. \"That’s my old coffee can. I used to keep bolts in it.\"\n\n\"You keep bolts in everything,\" Stephanie said. \"You’d keep bolts in a baby’s shoe if it had a lid.\"\n\nScott scratched his chin. \"I’d keep ‘em organized, at least.\"\n\nBo rose and did a slow circle around the tree, nose working. He pressed his snout to the ground, then to the trunk, then to the grass again. He stopped and stared toward the fence line that ran along the road.\n\nRight then, a pickup eased by on the gravel, tires crunching, and slowed like it was looking for an address. The driver’s window rolled down. It was Mr. Harlan from a couple places over, with his ball cap pulled low and his arm hanging out like it belonged there.\n\n\"Mornin’,\" he called. \"Y’all lose a coffee can?\"\n\nScott lifted his hand in greeting. \"Apparently I lost it and then gained it back as art.\"\n\nMr. Harlan laughed. \"That’d be my grandson. Toby. He’s been on a ‘recycling kick.’ Calls it ‘up-cycling,’ like we been ridin’ bicycles made of trash all these years.\"\n\nStephanie smiled. \"That’s sweet.\"\n\n\"Sweet until he starts ‘up-cycling’ my good tools,\" Mr. Harlan said, but you could hear the pride hiding under the complaint. \"He said he saw your dog sit out here like he owned the place, and he wanted to ‘decorate the vibe.’\"\n\nScott looked at Bo, who sat perfectly still under the pecan tree as if he’d been hired to do it. \"Well, Bo does have standards.\"\n\nMr. Harlan jerked his thumb toward the road. \"Anyway, Toby’s gonna swing by later and apologize if he ‘borrowed’ somethin’ without askin’.\"\n\n\"Tell him it’s fine,\" Stephanie called. \"But next time, he can ask first—and we’ll give him better twine.\"\n\n\"Deal,\" Mr. Harlan said, and rolled on down the road, leaving a thin wake of dust that drifted over the ditch like a lazy fog.\n\nScott and Stephanie stood there for a moment, listening to the coffee can chime. It wasn’t fancy, but it had a kind of music that fit the place—like the land didn’t want quiet so much as it wanted company.\n\nBo suddenly sneezed, then trotted a few steps and stopped again, staring hard at the brush near the fence. His tail stiffened.\n\nScott’s eyes followed. \"What you got, boy?\"\n\nA rustle came from the edge of the cedar. Out waddled an armadillo—low to the ground, nosing around like it was late for an appointment. It moved slow and stubborn, armor plates shifting with each step. It paid no mind to the humans on the porch side, and it definitely didn’t pay any mind to Bo, who looked personally offended by the creature’s confidence.\n\n\"Well,\" Stephanie said, \"there’s your wild animal for the day.\"\n\nScott crossed his arms. \"Looks like he’s huntin’ grubs.\"\n\nBo took two steps forward, then stopped. He didn’t bark. He just watched, head tilted, trying to solve the armadillo like a puzzle piece that didn’t belong to any set.\n\nThe armadillo snuffled along the fence line, dug a little hole like it was checking the soil’s opinion, then shuffled on. Bo kept pace a few yards away, escorting it politely, like a security guard who wasn’t sure whether the guest was important or lost.\n\nStephanie laughed softly. \"Bo’s got that look—like he wants to file a complaint with management.\"\n\n\"He is management,\" Scott said. \"We’re just… upper leadership.\"\n\nThey watched until the armadillo disappeared back into the cedar. Bo returned to the pecan tree, sat again, and glanced up at the coffee-can chime as if to make sure it was still behaving.\n\nStephanie reached up and tapped the tin strips with her finger. They clinked together, gentle and bright in the crisp air. \"You know,\" she said, \"I like it. It’s not pretty-pretty, but it’s got heart.\"\n\nScott nodded. \"That’s most things worth keepin’.\"\n\nThey headed back to the porch, Bo following close like he was herding them into their proper seats. Scott sat down and resumed his slow rocking, and Stephanie wrapped her quilt tighter around her shoulders. The coffee-can chime kept time with the wind, uneven but steady, like a neighbor whistling while he worked.\n\nA little while later, they heard another vehicle—lighter this time. An ATV stopped at the gate, and a boy’s voice called out, hesitant but hopeful.\n\n\"Ma’am? Sir? I’m sorry about the coffee can. I thought it was throwed away.\"\n\nStephanie leaned forward with a warm smile. \"Come on up, Toby. You didn’t hurt anything. We just wondered where it came from.\"\n\nThe boy walked up slow, hands in his pockets, hair sticking out from under his cap. He looked up at the porch and then at Bo, who met his gaze with the seriousness of a dog who believed in manners.\n\n\"I wanted it to sound like the farm,\" Toby said, glancing toward the pecan tree. \"Like… like when folks are out workin’ but you can still hear the house.\"\n\nScott’s expression softened. \"That’s a good idea. And you did fine work. Next time, just ask. I got more cans.\"\n\nToby’s face brightened. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Really,\" Stephanie said. \"And if you’re gonna make things, you might as well have good supplies.\"\n\nBo took a step forward and sniffed Toby’s boot, then sat back down. The verdict, apparently, was ‘acceptable.’\n\nToby grinned. \"Your dog’s like a sheriff.\"\n\n\"He is,\" Scott said. \"He just works for treats instead of taxes.\"\n\nToby laughed, waved, and headed back toward his ATV. The farm settled again into its morning rhythm—the distant calls, the slow breeze, the steady porch.\n\nScott took a sip of coffee and listened to the coffee-can chime hanging in the pecan tree, ringing soft and true over Pickton Farms. \"Well,\" he said, \"guess we got ourselves a new sound around here.\"\n\nStephanie leaned her head against his shoulder. \"It fits,\" she said. \"Like it was always supposed to be here—just needed somebody young enough to think of it.\""
